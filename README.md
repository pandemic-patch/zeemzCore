# Zeemz
Zeemz: The Versipisces Secret game engine (aka "ZeemzCore") is written in Solidity for Ethereum smart contracts and utilizes the LoomSDK for side-chain transactions. This makes Zeemz a multi-layer blockchain game.

## About Zeemz
See [Zeemz-Ann](https://github.com/pushingbhutons/zeemz-ann/) for full details of the project.

## Bug Bounties (Coming Soon)
I'm just a blogger, trying to make an invisible universe tangible. If you find bugs in my code, please, please, please, let me know. Submit a pull request or create an issue. I get to everything as quickly as health, life, and mitigating circumstances allow. Once the Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons (PSBT) token is live, I'll set bounties for bugs based on typical levels of severity, with critical issues receiving the highest bounties. I'll use Gitcoin's suggestions to create fair bounties.
